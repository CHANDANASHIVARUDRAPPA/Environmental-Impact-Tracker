# ðŸŒ± Environmental Impact Tracker

> A Flask-based web application to help users track and reduce their environmental footprint through electricity and water usage monitoring, intelligent suggestions, and community-driven rankings.

---

##  Project Description

The **Environmental Impact Tracker** is a full-stack application that allows users to:

* Monitor their monthly **electricity and water consumption**
* Receive **intelligent suggestions** to reduce overuse
* View a **leaderboard-style ranking** based on lowest consumption
* Enable **admin functionalities** like managing users and logs

This project was built as part of an academic Database Management System (DBMS) mini-project, showcasing a complete flow from **ER modeling**, **MySQL triggers, procedures, and functions**, to **Flask backend** and **HTML-based frontend**.

---

##  Features

### Authentication

* Role-based login: **Admin** and **User**
* User session management

###  Admin Dashboard

* Add/view/delete usage logs (water and electricity)
* Manage user roles and credentials
* Perform all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

###  User Dashboard

* Submit monthly usage logs
* View personalized suggestions based on consumption
* Leaderboard ranking (lower usage = higher rank)
* View history and insights

### DBMS Features

* **5+ SQL Queries** used across the app
* **Triggers**: Auto-updates and data checks
* **Stored Procedures**: For user deletion and log handling
* **Functions**: Threshold check for water/electricity usage
* **Privileges**: Separate privileges for Admin and Users
* **Derived Attributes**: Auto-computed total consumption

## Setup Instructions

###  Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* MySQL Server
* `pip install mysql-connector-python`
* Basic HTML/Jinja knowledge

---

###  Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/environmental-impact-tracker.git
cd environmental-impact-tracker
```

2. **Install Requirements**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Create MySQL Database**

Open MySQL shell:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE environmentalimpacttracker;
USE environmentalimpacttracker;
```

Then run all the table creation scripts, triggers, functions, and stored procedures provided in `/sql_scripts.sql`.

>  Ensure the following tables are created: `User`, `Electricity_Logs`, `Water_Logs`, `Suggestions`

4. **Insert Initial Data**

```sql
-- Sample Admin
INSERT INTO User (Name, Email, Location, Password, RoleRank)
VALUES ('Admin', 'admin@tracker.com', 'HQ', 'admin123', 'Admin');

-- Sample User
INSERT INTO User (Name, Email, Location, Password, RoleRank)
VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@gmail.com', 'Bangalore', 'user123', 'User');
```

5. **Run the Application**

```bash
python app.py
```

6. **Access the App**

Open your browser and go to:
`http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

##  Usage Flow

| Action               | Page               |
| -------------------- | ------------------ |
| Visit Home           | `/`                |
| Login as User/Admin  | `/login`           |
| Admin Dashboard      | `/admin_dashboard` |
| User Dashboard       | `/user_dashboard`  |
| Manage Users (Admin) | `/manage_users`    |

---

##  Smart DBMS Logic

###  Triggers:

* Auto-updates rankings after a new log is inserted

###  Functions:

* `CheckWaterUsageThreshold()`: returns TRUE if usage > 100
* `CheckElectricityUsageThreshold()`: returns TRUE if usage > 200

###  Procedures:

* Deleting a user and associated logs
* Inserting logs with integrity checks

---

##  Sample SQL Queries Used

```sql
-- Total water usage by user
SELECT SUM(Water_Usage) FROM Water_Logs WHERE User_ID = 1;

-- Top 5 users by lowest total usage
SELECT User_ID, (SUM(Water_Usage) + SUM(Electricity_Usage)) AS Total
FROM Water_Logs
JOIN Electricity_Logs USING(User_ID)
GROUP BY User_ID
ORDER BY Total ASC
LIMIT 5;
```

##  Future Enhancements

* Email alerts for excessive usage
* Graph-based usage tracking
* API version for mobile app integration
* Export user reports as PDF
